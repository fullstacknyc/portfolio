AdSense setup checklist

1. Verify site ownership in Google Search Console
   - Add your site (https://your-domain.example)
   - Verify via HTML file upload or DNS record

2. Submit sitemap
   - In Search Console, submit `/sitemap.xml` (update hostnames in the file first)

3. Ensure policy pages exist
   - Privacy policy: `/privacy.html` (created)
   - Contact page: `/contact.html` (created)
   - About page: `/about.html` (created)

4. Ensure content quality
   - Original content, clear navigation, and no prohibited content (adult, copyright-infringing, hate, etc.)

5. Apply for AdSense
   - Sign in to AdSense and apply for your site URL
   - AdSense will check your site for policy compliance and may contact you

6. After approval
   - Add AdSense ad code snippets to your pages where you want ads to appear
   - Optionally add your `ads.txt` publisher entry

Notes:
- Replace placeholder domain URLs in `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` with your real domain before submission.
- If you use a static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel), ensure the above files are deployed at the root.
